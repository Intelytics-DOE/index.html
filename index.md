## Our Research Focus

### 1. **Application Performance Optimization**
We analyze and optimize the performance of large-scale applications, ensuring they make efficient use of computational resources. Our work spans multiple domains, including climate modeling, molecular dynamics, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on scalability and parallelism.

### 2. **Scalable Algorithms for HPC**
We design and implement new algorithms tailored to take full advantage of modern supercomputing architectures, including multi-core processors and distributed memory systems.

### 3. **Performance Monitoring and Profiling Tools**
We develop advanced profiling tools that monitor application performance in real-time, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks and improve computational efficiency.

### 4. **Energy-Efficient Computing**
Our research also explores methods to minimize the energy consumption of large-scale computations without sacrificing performance, contributing to the sustainability of supercomputing environments.
